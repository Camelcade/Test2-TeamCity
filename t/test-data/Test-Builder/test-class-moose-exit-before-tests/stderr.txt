A context appears to have been destroyed without first calling release().
Based on $@ it does not look like an exception was thrown (this is not always
a reliable test)

This is a problem because the global error variables ($!, $@, and $?) will
not be restored. In addition some release callbacks will not work properly from
inside a DESTROY method.

Here are the context creation details, just in case a tool forgot to call
release():
  File: {FILE}
  Line: {LINE}
  Tool: {TOOL}
