=head1 NAME

Test2::TeamCity Test Suite

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This directory contains tests for testing the Test2::TeamCity system.

When MaxMind wrote this module there were three main senarios we wanted to
make sure worked:

=over

=item When using Test::Class::Moose

=item When using a traditional Test::Builder based test suite (Test::More)

=item When using the shiny new Test2 based test suite (Test2::Suite)

=back

Each one of these senarios are represented by their own C<.t> file in the top
level directory (C<Test-Class-Moose.t>, C<Test-Builder.t> and C<Test2.t>
respectively) that all use the L<T> module's C<run_tests> sub with different
arguments.

The L<T> module is responsible for actually running these tests.
